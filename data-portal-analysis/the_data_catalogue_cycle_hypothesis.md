# The Data Catalogue Update Cycle Hypothesis: Do Datasets Appear In Waves?


Governments and institution publish open data often as part of a collection. A minimum requirement for these [data catalogues](http://datacatalogs.org/) are discoverable and up-to-date datasets. Below is a lax methodological outline, which we will follow through with three case studies.


H | Research null hypothesis
: ------------ | : ------------- 
1a | *Data catalogues publish datasets evenly over time.*
1b | *Datasets in data catalogues are continuously updated.* 


<!--Research null hypothesis 1a:
*Data catalogues publish datasets evenly over time.*

Research null hypothesis 1b:
*Datasets in data catalogues are continuously updated.*-->

Notice how rejecting hypothesis 1a is unrelated to hypothesis 1b. We have little information for how often datasets have to be updated. An uneven release cycle could mean that datasets have different update schedules. In fact, this is quite probable. Thus, how can we distinguish between:

1. datasets that differ substantially in their update cycle; and
2. "waves" of updating datasets unrelated to the availability at the source?

The answer will only be qualitative and suggestive. Let's start by having a look at the meta-information released by the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org). 

## 1. The World Bank Data Catalogue

The original [meta-data](http://datacatalog.worldbank.org/) contains 162 catalogues. For the columns "update frequency" and "last revision date" information for around 15% are missing. If not stated otherwise they are removed. 

The catalogues were last update as follows:

2005 | 2006| 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013
 --: | --: |  --: | --:  |  --: | --:  | --:  | --:  | --:
   6 | 0   | 0    |  1   |    6 |  12  |  18  |  18  |  75 
   
We can see that the World Bank updated more than half of its data catalogues this year.

#### Figure 1: World Bank data catalogue last revision date

(The 2005 figures are an artefact because in the original data they are dated as 1905.)

It's also clear that we can reject hypothesis 1a. The update cycle has clear spikes in certain months and is not uniform over the years.

### Taking the update frequency into account

Not all datasets have to be updated within the last year. Below we can see that some update frequencies are longer than a year or are even not planned.

#### Figure 2: World Bank data catalogue update frequency
![update frequency](https://raw.github.com/theodi/R-projects/master/data-portal-analysis/graphics/update-frequency.png)

First, let's remove the 23 catalogues that are not planned to be updated.
Secondly, let's inspect the update frequency for those catalogues that have not been updated in 2013.

#### Figure 3: World Bank data catalogue update frequency excluding 2013
![update frequency not 2013](https://raw.github.com/theodi/R-projects/master/data-portal-analysis/graphics/update-frequency-not2013.png)

This looks promising: it's possible that for around half of them there was no reason to update the catalogue in 2013. 

### Conclusion

The World Bank updates its data catalogues with an irregular schedule. However, of the 102 data catalogues that have revision dates and are planned to be updated, only 39 were not revised in 2013. We estimate that for these 39 data catalogues around half do not have an updated release. (The number of missing dates is relatively large, which is a substantial caveat.)

<!--This is a positive framing â€“ we could also say "hasn't updated around 20%"-->
This means that the World Bank updates around 80% of its data catalogues. In this case study we therefore *cannot* reject hypothesis 1b: despite the uneven release cycle we may support the hypothesis that data catalogues are continuously updated.

## 2. The London Datastore

The [London datastore](arsnteioa) currently hosts 537 datasets.
